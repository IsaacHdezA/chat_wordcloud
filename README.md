# Telegram Word Cloud

Get some basic statistics on you and your friend's Telegram chats!

The purpose of this tiny project is to remake basically the same one as I did a
couple of years ago. But with more knowledge, experience and all that. I think I
am able to create something a little bit more structured and useful now.

The main thing of this is to be able to input a valid Telegram chat .json and as
an output, you'll get the cloud of words that reigns in your chats so you can
discuss it and have a laugh over all the words you and your friends use more.

## Basic setup

1. Create the project's isolated environment with:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv .env
```

2. Install project dependencies:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
